            In 1897, Angeline Burr and her four children arrived in Denton from
            Arkansas. She was the first African-American woman to purchase land
            in Quakertown, she owned three homes that she rented out, some of
            which were even rented out by white tenants. She was known in
            Quakertown as “Aunt Angeline” and was well loved. She was a nurse
            and midwife who helped deliver both black and white babies. Miss
            Angeline is the only known departure mentioned in the Denton Record
            and Chronicle after the people of Quakertown were forced out of
            their homes. She and her family decided to move to California
            instead of moving to Solomon Hill like many of her neighbors.
